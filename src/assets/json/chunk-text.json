    "about": "Originally from India, I spent my pre-college years in Dubai (yes, the city with the world's tallest building and the world's largest malls). Now, I'm pursuing my studies in Ann Arbor. As an experienced software engineer, I specialize in full-stack web development, data science, and machine learning. When I'm not busy debugging my life, you'll find me reading self-help books, jamming to Bollywood tunes, playing table tennis, or lifting weights at the gym. Fun fact (or maybe not so fun): I hit my peak weight of 140kg in the summer of 2020. After a reality check from my doctors and to ease my parents' worries, I embarked on a rigorous fitness journey. I even founded an online community called Fitness Freakâ€”naturally scaled up with React, because why not add some code to the workout?"
